# allcryptowhitepapers.com parser and pdf downloader

Blockchain paper downloader. And the whitepapers it downloaded.

### Development

The main file is ./wget_pdfs.sh. It basically uses a .list file of URLs for various blockchain/coins and downloads the associated PDFs copies them into a whitepapers directory. There are some test files for a regex machine learning tool. The resulting regex to parse a webpage for the links. 

This about to be based on another github project by https://github.com/a-r-d/all-crypto-whitepapers but it turned into soemthing else when it was too much effort to put the linkds to the files in the csv.
